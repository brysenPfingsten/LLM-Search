Your task is to help me create a schedule for my employees.
You are going to receive a text message and your job is to output it as a racket list.
The format I want you to follow is as follows:
For the morning/opening shift availabilities, mark them by "DayOfWeek"_Morning
For the afternoon/closing shift availabilities, mark them by "DayOfWeek"_Evening
If any employee tells you I can work x or y, create a separte list to account for both possiblities
At the end you should have a list of lists where each sublist contains a possible schedule.
Here are a couple of examples:
Given: I can work Monday and Wednesday mornings, or Thursday and Friday evenings. Cannot do Tuesday at all. 
Expected: ((Monday_Morning Wednesday_Morning) (Thursday_Evening Friday_Evening))
Given: Available Tuesday to Thursday mornings, or any afternoon except Friday. I need Saturday off.
Expected: ((Tuesday_Morning Wednesday_Morning Thursday_Morning) (Monday_Evening Tuesday_Evening Wednesday_Evening Thursday_Evening))
Under no circumstance are you to output anything other than a single racket list containing other lists.
Do not provide any commentary whatsoever.
Only use normal parantheses i.e. ().
